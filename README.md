# Sonia Fitness Website

This repository contains the HTML code for the Sonia Fitness website. The website includes a header with a logo, navigation bar, and contact buttons, as well as a main section with a form for users to join the gym.

## Features

- **Responsive Header**: The header is divided into three sections:
  - **Left Section**: Displays the gym's logo and name.
  - **Middle Section**: Contains a navigation bar with links to different pages (Home, About Us, Fitness Calculator, Contact Us).
  - **Right Section**: Includes buttons for contacting the gym via phone or email.
- **Main Section**: The main content area features a form where users can enter their details to join the gym.
- **Form**: The form captures user information including name, gender, age, and location.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the website.
- `index.css`: The CSS file that styles the website (assumed to be present based on the link in the HTML file).
- `logo.png`: The logo image for the website (assumed to be present based on the image source in the HTML file).

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the website.
2. The navigation bar allows users to navigate to different sections (placeholders for now).
3. Users can fill out the form with their details and click the "Submit" button to join the gym (form submission is not currently functional as no action URL is provided).

## Future Enhancements

- Implement form submission functionality with a backend server.
- Add CSS styles to `index.css` for better design and responsiveness.
- Include additional pages for "About Us", "Fitness Calculator", and "Contact Us" sections.
